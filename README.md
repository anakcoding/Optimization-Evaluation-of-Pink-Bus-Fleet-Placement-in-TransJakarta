# Introduction

**TransJakarta**, also known as busway, is one of the transportation programs supported by the government to reduce traffic congestion in Jakarta. This program is also claimed to provide public transportation with guaranteed comfort facilities. According to information from the official website, **TransJakarta** is the first **Bus Rapid Transit (BRT)** system in Southeast and South Asia, which has been operating since 2004 in Jakarta. The Provincial Government of DKI Jakarta operates **TransJakarta** as a solution to address traffic congestion, with the hope of encouraging private vehicle users to switch to using the **TransJakarta** service.

Public transportation plays a crucial role in urban mobility, including the services provided by **TransJakarta**, which serves millions of passengers daily. However, one of the main challenges faced is the issue of safety, particularly concerning **sexual harassment** cases frequently experienced by female passengers. This situation not only creates a sense of insecurity but also has the potential to reduce public interest, especially among women, in using public transportation.

## Problem Statement
Although **TransJakarta** has been operating pink buses in five main corridors, no data analysis has been conducted to ensure their optimal placement. Without such an analysis, it is difficult to confirm whether the fleet placement meets the needs of **female passenger safety and comfort**. Data analysis is required to verify the effectiveness of the pink bus placement.

### Key Questions

1. **Does the placement of the pink buses meet the needs of female passengers in each corridor?**

2. **Are there other corridors that would benefit more from the pink bus fleet based on female passenger data?**

## Conclusion

Based on the data analysis of **passenger density** and the **proportion of women aged 18-35**, it can be concluded that the placement of the **pink bus** fleet in the five main corridors (**Corridors 2, 3, 9, 13, and 5C**) has not been fully optimized. Some key findings are as follows:

1. **Corridors Served by Pink Buses**:  
   In the corridors currently served by **Pink Buses**, most still show relatively low passenger density compared to the **median value**. This indicates that the placement of the **pink bus** fleet does not fully meet passenger needs, particularly in corridors with high demand.

2. **Corridors with a High Proportion of Female Passengers**:  
   Some other corridors, such as **Corridor 6B** (with a female passenger proportion of **92.13%**) and **M12** (with a female passenger proportion of **67.31%**), show a much higher concentration of female passengers compared to the corridors already served by **Pink Buses**. These corridors require additional placement of **Pink Buses** to provide a sense of safety and comfort, especially for female passengers who are at risk of potential sexual harassment.

3. **High Density in Some Other Corridors**:  
   Corridors such as **8A** and **13** show relatively high passenger density and a significant proportion of female passengers, so the placement of **Pink Buses** in these corridors should also be considered to improve comfort and reduce the risk of discomfort for female passengers.

## Recommendations

1. **Reevaluate the Placement of the Pink Bus Fleet in the Five Main Corridors**:  
   The placement of **Pink Buses** in the five main corridors (**Corridors 2, 3, 9, 13, and 5C**) should be further evaluated, particularly for corridors with low passenger density. **Pink Buses** should be prioritized in corridors with higher passenger density and a significant proportion of female passengers to ensure efficient fleet utilization.

2. **Increase the Pink Bus Fleet in Corridors with a High Proportion of Female Passengers**:  
   Based on the analysis, corridors such as **6B**, **M12**, and **8A** show a **high proportion of female passengers** and **significant passenger density**. Adding more **Pink Buses** to these corridors will improve safety and comfort for female passengers, especially on routes with more than 50% female passengers aged 18-35.

3. **Increase Passenger Density and Fleet Usage Efficiency**:  
   As a follow-up, the placement of **Pink Buses** should be based on **passenger density data** and the **proportion of female passengers aged 18-35**. This will allow for more efficient fleet usage, ensuring that buses are deployed only in corridors that truly require them, avoiding resource wastage and ensuring more optimal service.

4. **Regular Monitoring and Adjustment**:  
   Given the changing patterns of passengers over time, regular monitoring and evaluation of passenger density and the proportion of female passengers in each corridor is essential. This will ensure that the **Pink Bus** fleet is always placed in the most needed locations, effectively providing a sense of safety for female passengers.
