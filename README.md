# Introduction

**TransJakarta**, also known as busway, is one of the transportation programs supported by the government to reduce traffic congestion in Jakarta. This program is also claimed to provide public transportation with guaranteed comfort facilities. According to information from the official website, **TransJakarta** is the first **Bus Rapid Transit (BRT)** system in Southeast and South Asia, which has been operating since 2004 in Jakarta. The Provincial Government of DKI Jakarta operates **TransJakarta** as a solution to address traffic congestion, with the hope of encouraging private vehicle users to switch to using the **TransJakarta** service.

Public transportation plays a crucial role in urban mobility, including the services provided by **TransJakarta**, which serves millions of passengers daily. However, one of the main challenges faced is the issue of safety, particularly concerning **sexual harassment** cases frequently experienced by female passengers. This situation not only creates a sense of insecurity but also has the potential to reduce public interest, especially among women, in using public transportation.

## Problem Statement
Although **TransJakarta** has been operating pink buses in five main corridors, no data analysis has been conducted to ensure their optimal placement. Without such an analysis, it is difficult to confirm whether the fleet placement meets the needs of **female passenger safety and comfort**. Data analysis is required to verify the effectiveness of the pink bus placement.

### Key Questions

1. **Does the placement of the pink buses meet the needs of female passengers in each corridor?**

2. **Are there other corridors that would benefit more from the pink bus fleet based on female passenger data?**
